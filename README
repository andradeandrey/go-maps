Generalized maps for the Go Programming Language: 
------------------------------------------------

- These containers are targeted at storing aggregate types.
- These maps accept as keys all interfaces which implement a Key() method (see example maps_test.go).

This is an attempt at generalizing the Go built-in map type to aggregate types.
Thanks to Nigel Tao and Roger Peppe for their suggestions and support !
